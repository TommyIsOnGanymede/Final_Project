    "### In order to determine the best neighborhood to buy a house, I will take into account our three metrics in a specific order:\n",
    "1) **Crime Rate**, because nobody wants to feel unsafe in their home.\n",
    "2) **Number of Homes With Tax Delinquency**, this metric is important because as a broke college student buying a home that is in debt creates an opportunity for buying discounted homes during an auction.\n",
    "3) **Number of Parks in the Neighborhood**, because having a green space close to home has been proven to improve mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking into account these three variables it is clear that the best neighborhood to buy a house is Point Breeze. Located on the East End Point Breeze has a very low crime rate being 10x safer than the Downtown area. Point Breeze also has 120 homes that could be potentially sold for cheap at a auction making it a very attainable home. The icing on the cake is of corse it's proximity to parks, Point Breeze is has 7 parks within its border making it a very attractive neighborhood for buying a home. "
